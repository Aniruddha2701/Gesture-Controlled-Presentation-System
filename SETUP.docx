# Gesture-Controlled Presentation System – Installation Guide

## Prerequisites

- **Python** (version 3.8 or higher)
- **pip** (Python package manager; included with most Python installations)
- **Git** (optional; for cloning the repository)
- **Webcam** (720p or better recommended)
- **Internet Connection** (to download dependencies)

## 1. Clone the Repository

1. Open a terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell, or Terminal).
2. Run:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Aniruddha2701/Gesture-Controlled-Presentation-System.git
   ```

3. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd Gesture-Controlled-Presentation-System/GesturePresentation
   ```

## 2. Install Python Dependencies

All required Python packages are listed in `requirements.txt`.

**Option 1: Install all dependencies at once**

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Option 2: Install packages individually**

```
pip install opencv-python mediapipe pyautogui numpy pillow pygetwindow pyqt5 pyttsx3 pywinauto
```

## 3. Running the Application

1. Go to the source folder:

   ```
   cd src
   ```

2. To launch the main application:

   ```
   python main.py
   ```

3. A window will open showing webcam input with gesture feedback overlays.

## 4. Common Troubleshooting

- If you get errors about missing packages, ensure you installed all dependencies as described above.
- For `pyautogui` to control your presentation, keep the presentation window active/focused.
- If the webcam does not turn on, make sure it is not being used by another application.

## 5. Project Structure Overview

- **src/**: Source code modules.
- **data/**: (Optional) Gesture sample datasets.
- **docs/**: Documentation, diagrams, and planning.
